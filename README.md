## ⚠️ Constraints

- **Artifacts Folder Naming:**  
    Always name your folders inside `Artifacts/` using this format:  
    ```
    RepoName-githubJobID-branch-env-brand-team-workflowName
    ```
    Example:  
    ```
    ecommerce-omnichannel-fta-120-DevRegression-Dev-EECOL-Poweruser-workflow1
    ```

- This naming convention helps in easy identification and organization of test artifacts.
- Avoid spaces and special characters in folder names.
- Stick to this format for all new artifact folders.
